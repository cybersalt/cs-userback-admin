# Cybersalt Userback Admin (Joomla Plugin)

A Joomla 5 System Plugin that injects the [Userback](https://userback.io) feedback widget into the **Joomla Administrator (backend)**.  
This makes it easy for administrators to capture feedback, report bugs, and share suggestions directly from the backend interface.

---

## ✨ Features

- Adds the Userback widget to Joomla's administrator area.
- Allows team members to submit visual feedback without leaving the backend.
- Configuration via plugin parameters — no template editing required.
- Safe guards to prevent backend crashes if no token is configured.
